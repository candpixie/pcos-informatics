### pcos-informatics
bioinformatics on PCOS | ML model analysis
- an independent research project exploring ML and bioinformatics approaches for understanding and analyzing PCOS-related data

### repo structure:
- `notebooks/` — experiments, EDA, ML models
- `data/` — raw + processed datasets (or links)
- `literature/` — notes on papers
- `scripts/` — helper functions

### TLDR, what's PCOS & motivation?
PCOS, aka Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a hormonal disorder that affects 10-13% women worldwide (Teede, H. J. et al)
unfortunately, at the start of freshman year, I was officially diagnosed with PCOS
TBH I was not given an actual reason, as there isn't a simple cause for PCOS. 
In fact, PCOS is understudied and sometimes diagnosis may seem unclear. 
That's why I decided to help myself to look more into the disease I am having.

### upcoming goals:
- Build a baseline ML classifier for PCOS diagnosis
- Run gene expression differential analysis using public datasets (GEO)
- Summarize key PCOS literature and biomarkers
